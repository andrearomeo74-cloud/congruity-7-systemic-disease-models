# Aging as loss of systemic congruity

## Conceptual framing

Within Congruity 7.0, aging is not a disease but a progressive loss of proportionality across core system dimensions:

- Energy (E)
- Information (I)
- Structure (S)
- Functional Value (V)

Aging emerges when these dimensions deteriorate at different rates, breaking systemic coherence.

## Core dynamics

Typical aging trajectories show:

- Gradual energy depletion (mitochondrial efficiency, metabolic cost)
- Information drift (epigenetic noise, signaling loss)
- Structural fatigue (cellular and tissue integrity)
- Declining functional value (resilience, adaptability)

The system does not fail immediately — it becomes increasingly fragile.

## Relationship to disease

Aging acts as a systemic amplifier:

- Neurodegenerative diseases follow aging-driven collapse dynamics
- Cancer exploits aging-weakened constraints via active evasion

Aging therefore defines the pre-pathological loss of congruity that enables disease emergence.

## Scope and limits

This model is:

- Theoretical
- Non-clinical
- Non-therapeutic

It provides a system-level interpretation, not medical guidance.
