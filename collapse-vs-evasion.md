# Collapse vs Evasion in Congruity 7.0

Congruity 7.0 distinguishes two fundamentally different modes of systemic failure:

## 1. Systemic Collapse (Neurodegeneration, Aging)

Collapse is defined as a progressive loss of proportionality across E–I–S–V:
- Energy (E) decreases
- Information (I) degrades
- Structure (S) disorganizes
- Functional Value (V) diminishes

This process is characterized by:
- Decline, not strategy
- Loss, not exploitation
- Entropy amplification

Examples:
- Alzheimer’s disease
- Parkinson’s disease
- Huntington’s disease
- Aging-related degeneration

Collapse is passive and irreversible beyond critical thresholds.

## 2. Active Evasion (Cancer)

Evasion is defined as a selective violation of congruity constraints:
- V (local functional value) increases disproportionally
- E–I–S constraints are bypassed
- Systemic proportionality is actively broken

This process is characterized by:
- Proliferation without coordination
- Resource hijacking
- Structural rule-breaking

Cancer is not collapse, but adversarial optimization against system-level congruity.

## Conceptual Implication

Collapse and evasion are not symmetric.
They require different models, thresholds, and intervention logics.

Congruity 7.0 treats:
- Neurodegeneration as loss of proportionality
- Cancer as evasion of proportionality
