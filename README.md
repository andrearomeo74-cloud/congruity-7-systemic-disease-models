# Congruity 7.0 – Systemic Disease Models

## Abstract
This repository collects **theoretical extensions of the Congruity 7.0 framework** applied to systemic diseases.
Pathology is modeled as a **loss of systemic proportionality** between:

- **E** – Energy  
- **I** – Information  
- **S** – Structure  
- **V** – Functional Value  

This work is **theoretical, non-clinical, and non-therapeutic** in nature.

## Foundational Principle
Within Congruity 7.0, health corresponds to a stable proportionality across E–I–S–V.
Disease emerges when this proportionality is progressively lost, amplified, or actively evaded.

Conceptual reference formula:

\[
C = \frac{V}{E + I + S}
\]

Loss of congruity may manifest as:
- progressive decline (aging, neurodegeneration),
- active evasion (cancer),
- primary informational incoherence (genetic disorders).

## Scope and Limitations
- This repository presents **conceptual and modeling frameworks only**
- It does **not** provide diagnosis, treatment, or medical advice
- No clinical protocols are proposed
- Any practical application requires **independent empirical validation**

---

## Application Domains (in development)

### 1. Neurodegenerative Diseases
Congruity-based models of progressive neuronal proportionality loss:
- Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
- Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
- Huntington’s Disease (HD)

### 2. Cancer
Cancer modeled as **active systemic congruity evasion**:
- disproportionate proliferation,
- egoistic functional value,
- collapse of E–I–S constraints.

### 3. Epigenetics and Aging
- Accelerated epigenetic aging
- Senescence as a dual-system phenomenon
- Informational incoherence as a systemic trigger

---

## Roadmap
- Formal disease-specific conceptual models
- Integration with theoretical E–I–S–V biomarkers
- Structured comparison with existing empirical datasets (without overfitting)
