# Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) — Congruity 7.0

## Conceptual Framing
Within the Congruity 7.0 framework, Alzheimer’s disease is modeled as a
progressive and irreversible loss of systemic proportionality across
Energy (E), Information (I), Structure (S), and Functional Value (V).

## Dominant Axes of Congruity Loss
- Energy (E): mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic decline
- Information (I): epigenetic drift and signaling noise
- Structure (S): synaptic and cytoskeletal breakdown
- Functional Value (V): cognitive and adaptive collapse

## Aging Amplification
Alzheimer’s disease represents an amplification of age-related systemic
incoherence, where compensatory mechanisms progressively fail.

## Threshold Dynamics
Clinical manifestation emerges when cumulative E–I–S–V misalignment
crosses irreversible system-level thresholds.

## Scope and Limitations
This section is theoretical and non-clinical.
No diagnostic, therapeutic, or medical claims are proposed.
