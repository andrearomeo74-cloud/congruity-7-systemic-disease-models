# Parkinson’s Disease (PD) — Congruity 7.0

## Conceptual Framing
Within the Congruity 7.0 framework, Parkinson’s disease is modeled as a **progressive loss of systemic proportionality** across:

- Energy (E)
- Information (I)
- Structure (S)
- Functional Value (V)

Parkinson’s disease represents an **aging-amplified neurodegenerative process**, characterized by gradual collapse rather than active systemic evasion.

## Dominant Axes of Congruity Loss

- **Energy (E)**  
  Central mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons (Complex I impairment, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, elevated ROS) produces chronic energetic imbalance, amplified by aging.

- **Information (I)**  
  Impaired proteostasis signaling, altered transcriptional regulation, epigenetic drift, and loss of cellular quality-control programs generate informational incoherence that precedes neuronal loss.

- **Structure (S)**  
  Misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein, cytoskeletal destabilization, and altered mitochondrial dynamics progressively erode neuronal architecture.

- **Functional Value (V)**  
  Decline in dopaminergic signaling leads to loss of motor coordination, adaptive flexibility, and eventually cognitive and behavioral impairment.

## Aging Amplification
Parkinson’s disease reflects an amplification of age-related systemic incoherence.  
Compensatory mechanisms initially preserve function despite misalignment, but aging progressively reduces resilience, accelerating collapse across E–I–S–V domains.

---

## Threshold Dynamics
Clinical Parkinson’s disease emerges when cumulative E–I–S–V misalignment crosses **irreversible system-level thresholds**, rather than from isolated molecular damage.

Threshold crossing is:
- cumulative,
- nonlinear,
- and strongly age-dependent.

## Scope and Limitations
This section is **theoretical and non-clinical**.

No diagnostic, therapeutic, or medical recommendations are proposed.  
The model does not replace existing biological or clinical descriptions, but provides a **systemic proportionality framework** for interpretation.
