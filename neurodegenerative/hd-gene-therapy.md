# Gene Therapy in Huntington’s Disease — Congruity 7.0

## Conceptual Role of Gene Therapy
Within the Congruity 7.0 framework, gene therapies for Huntington’s disease
are modeled as **upstream informational realignment mechanisms**.

Rather than targeting downstream symptoms or isolated molecular effects,
gene therapies act by **reducing the primary source of informational
incoherence** generated by mutant huntingtin (mHTT).

## Primary Informational Correction
Expanded CAG repeats in the HTT gene introduce persistent informational
noise that propagates across:

- transcriptional regulation,
- epigenetic stability,
- proteostasis,
- cellular signaling coherence.

Gene therapy approaches aim to **attenuate or silence the upstream
informational disturbance**, restoring proportional signal integrity.

---

## One-Time Intervention Principle
Congruity 7.0 predicts maximal systemic benefit from:

- low-frequency,
- non-continuous,
- non-amplifying

interventions that correct **Information (I)** before irreversible
E–I–S–V misalignment occurs.

This distinguishes gene therapy from chronic downstream modulation,
which risks introducing new asymmetries.

---

## Systemic Effects Across Domains
Upstream informational correction produces secondary proportional effects:

- **Energy (E):** improved mitochondrial efficiency and metabolic stability,
- **Structure (S):** reduced aggregation pressure and cytoskeletal stress,
- **Functional Value (V):** preservation of adaptive capacity and motor-cognitive integration.

The therapeutic signal is therefore **systemic**, not localized.

---

## Threshold and Timing Dynamics
The Congruity framework emphasizes **timing sensitivity**:

- pre-symptomatic or early-stage intervention operates below collapse thresholds,
- late-stage intervention encounters structural irreversibility.

Gene therapy is thus conceptually aligned with **threshold prevention**, not reversal.

---

## Aging Interaction
Although Huntington’s disease is genetically determined, aging reduces
systemic resilience, amplifying the impact of informational noise.

Gene therapy lowers baseline incoherence, thereby **delaying aging-driven
threshold crossing** across E–I–S–V domains.

---

## Scope and Limitations
This section is **theoretical and non-clinical**.

No therapeutic efficacy, safety, or clinical outcomes are claimed.
Gene therapy is discussed solely as a **conceptual proportionality
correction mechanism** within the Congruity 7.0 framework.
