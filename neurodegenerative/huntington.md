# Huntington’s Disease (HD) — Congruity 7.0

## Conceptual Framing
Within the Congruity 7.0 framework, Huntington’s disease is modeled as a
**progressive and genetically triggered loss of systemic proportionality**
across:

- Energy (E)
- Information (I)
- Structure (S)
- Functional Value (V)

Unlike other neurodegenerative diseases, HD represents a **primary informational collapse** that propagates downstream across energy metabolism, cellular structure, and functional output.

## Dominant Axes of Congruity Loss

**Information (I) — Primary Driver**
Expanded CAG repeats in mutant huntingtin (mHTT) introduce chronic informational noise,
leading to:
- transcriptional dysregulation,
- epigenetic drift,
- impaired proteostasis,
- disrupted cellular signaling coherence.

Information loss precedes and amplifies downstream failures.

**Energy (E)**
Mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and energy imbalance
emerge as secondary consequences of informational incoherence.

**Structure (S)**
Protein aggregation, cytoskeletal destabilization, synaptic disintegration, and
striatal neuronal vulnerability reflect structural erosion driven by upstream E–I failure.

**Functional Value (V)**
Progressive loss of motor control, cognitive integrity, emotional regulation, and adaptive capacity represents collapse of functional value at the system level.

## Aging Amplification
Although genetically determined, Huntington’s disease is **aging-amplified**.
Age-related decline in resilience accelerates the propagation of E–I–S–V misalignment,
lowering thresholds for irreversible dysfunction.

---

## Threshold Dynamics
Clinical manifestation emerges when cumulative E–I–S–V misalignment crosses
**irreversible system-level thresholds**, characterized by:

- cumulative effects,
- non-linear escalation,
- partial independence from symptom severity at early stages.

Disease progression reflects systemic incoherence rather than isolated molecular toxicity.

## Scope and Limitations
This section is **theoretical and non-clinical**.

No diagnostic, therapeutic, or medical recommendations are proposed.
This model does not replace genetic, molecular, or clinical descriptions, but provides a
**systemic proportionality framework** for interpreting Huntington’s disease progression.
