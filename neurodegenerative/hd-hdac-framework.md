# HDAC Inhibitors in Huntington’s Disease — Congruity 7.0

## Conceptual Positioning
Within the Congruity 7.0 framework, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are modeled as
**downstream informational realignment tools**, acting at the level of
epigenetic signal regulation rather than genetic correction.

They do not remove the primary informational source (mHTT), but modulate
how informational noise is expressed and propagated.

---

## Epigenetic Incoherence in HD
Mutant huntingtin disrupts transcriptional coherence by:

- sequestering histone acetyltransferases (e.g. CBP/p300),
- inducing histone hypoacetylation,
- altering chromatin accessibility,
- destabilizing gene identity programs.

This produces a **compressed and rigid transcriptional state**, reducing
adaptive responsiveness.

---

## Role of HDAC Inhibition
HDAC inhibitors partially restore informational proportionality by:

- increasing histone acetylation (H3/H4),
- re-expanding transcriptional dynamic range,
- improving signal-to-noise ratios at the gene regulation level.

Within Congruity 7.0, this represents **local informational smoothing**,
not upstream correction.

---

## Selectivity and Proportionality
Congruity predicts that only **selective and proportionate** HDAC inhibition
is systemically coherent.

- Selective HDAC1/3 or class IIa inhibitors preserve proportional control.
- Broad-spectrum or chronic inhibition risks:
  - energetic overload,
  - transcriptional overshoot,
  - secondary systemic asymmetries.

Thus, **input scaling matters more than potency**.

---

## Systemic Effects Across Domains
When proportionate, epigenetic realignment produces secondary effects:

- **Energy (E):** improved mitochondrial transcription coordination,
- **Structure (S):** reduced aggregation pressure and cytoskeletal stress,
- **Functional Value (V):** enhanced adaptive capacity and network flexibility.

These effects remain **conditional and reversible**.

---

## Interaction with Aging
Aging reduces chromatin plasticity and buffering capacity.

As a result:
- HDACi efficacy declines with age,
- risk of overshoot increases,
- timing and dosage become critical.

HDAC inhibition is therefore most congruent **early or transiently**.

---

## Relationship to Gene Therapy
Within the Congruity hierarchy:

- Gene therapy targets **primary informational noise**,
- HDAC inhibitors modulate **secondary epigenetic expression**.

They are **complementary but non-substitutable** mechanisms.

---

## Scope and Limitations
This section is **theoretical and non-clinical**.

No therapeutic recommendations or efficacy claims are made.
HDAC inhibitors are described solely as **epigenetic proportionality
modulators** within the Congruity 7.0 framework.
