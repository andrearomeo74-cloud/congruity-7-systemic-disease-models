# Neurodegenerative Diseases – Congruity 7.0

## Conceptual Overview
Within the Congruity 7.0 framework, neurodegenerative diseases are modeled as
a **progressive loss of systemic proportionality** between:

- Energy (E)
- Information (I)
- Structure (S)
- Functional Value (V)

Unlike cancer, neurodegeneration is characterized by **decline and collapse**,
not by active evasion.

## Core Hypothesis
Neurodegenerative diseases represent an amplification of aging-related
systemic incoherence, where gradual E–I–S–V misalignment crosses irreversible
functional thresholds.

Mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, epigenetic drift,
neuroinflammation, and synaptic failure are interpreted as **coupled expressions
of the same proportionality loss**, not isolated causes.
Disease manifestation occurs when cumulative E–I–S–V misalignment crosses
critical system-level thresholds rather than isolated molecular failures.

## Diseases Covered
- Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
- Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
- Huntington’s Disease (HD)

Each condition corresponds to a **distinct dominant axis of congruity loss**
(E, I, or S), producing different clinical phenotypes.

## Scope and Limitations
This section is theoretical and non-clinical.
It does not propose diagnostics, treatments, or medical recommendations.
Future sections may include disease-specific conceptual models
without introducing clinical claims.
