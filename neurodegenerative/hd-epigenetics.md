# Epigenetic Incoherence in Huntington’s Disease — Congruity 7.0

## Conceptual Role of Epigenetics
Within the Congruity 7.0 framework, epigenetic regulation represents a
core component of the **Information (I)** domain.

In Huntington’s disease (HD), epigenetic mechanisms act as the primary
**propagation layer** through which genetically triggered informational
distortion spreads across the system.

Epigenetic dysfunction is therefore not secondary, but **structurally
causal** in systemic congruity loss.

## Information Collapse and Epigenetic Drift
Expanded CAG repeats in mutant huntingtin (mHTT) induce chronic
informational instability, resulting in:

- altered chromatin accessibility,
- transcriptional repression of neuronal identity genes,
- dysregulated enhancer–promoter coupling,
- progressive loss of transcriptional coherence.

This process is modeled as **epigenetic drift**, representing a
loss of informational proportionality over time.

## Histone Acetylation Imbalance
HD is associated with global hypoacetylation of histones H3 and H4,
driven by:

- sequestration of CBP/p300 by mHTT,
- overactivity or imbalance of HDAC-mediated deacetylation,
- failure of activity-dependent transcriptional regulation.

Within Congruity 7.0, this reflects **compression of the Information (I)
channel**, reducing adaptive bandwidth.

## Polycomb Dysregulation and PRC1 Signaling
Altered Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) activity contributes to:

- persistent repression of developmental and neuronal maintenance genes,
- abnormal persistence of repressive chromatin states,
- erosion of long-term informational memory.

This represents a failure of **informational boundary management**, where
past regulatory states override present functional requirements.

## Epigenetics as a Systemic Amplifier
Epigenetic incoherence acts as a **systemic amplifier**, translating
localized genetic perturbation into:

- energy inefficiency (E),
- structural fragility (S),
- and functional decline (V).

Thus, neurodegeneration emerges not from isolated toxicity, but from
progressive loss of informational proportionality across domains.

---

## Aging Interaction
Aging accelerates epigenetic drift by:

- reducing chromatin repair fidelity,
- increasing transcriptional noise,
- lowering resilience to informational perturbation.

This explains why Huntington’s disease, while genetic, remains
**age-amplified** in its progression.

## Scope and Limitations
This section is **theoretical and non-clinical**.

No therapeutic, diagnostic, or medical claims are made.
Epigenetic mechanisms are discussed solely as **conceptual components**
within a systemic proportionality framework.
