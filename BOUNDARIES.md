# Boundaries and Intended Use

This repository is a theoretical and conceptual extension of the Congruity 7.0 framework.

It is intended for:
- conceptual modeling,
- systemic interpretation of disease dynamics,
- cross-domain theoretical comparison.

It is NOT intended for:
- clinical use,
- diagnosis, treatment, or prevention,
- operational medical decision-making,
- executable or predictive systems.

All models are non-clinical, non-therapeutic, and require independent empirical validation.
